# Playtime

> This plugin was was originally from https://github.com/Armannnnnn/Playtime

Monitor and moderate playtime. Supports weekly playtime caps and automated weekly resets, as well as manual in-game resets/playtime checks.

This version does **not** work on paper spigot. The BukkitRunnables do not loop and I am not versed enough in Java to understand why.

  - [ ] Fix for Paper Spigot?
